<h1>Fashion-MNIST clothing image classification - Convolutional Neural Network</h1>

<b>Fashion MNIST</b> is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic <b><a href="https://github.com/rajatvisitme/cnn_mnist" target="_blank"><abbr title="MNIST handwritten digits classification">MNIST</abbr></a></b> dataset-often used as the <b>"Hello, World"</b> of machine learning programs for computer vision.<br/>
Fashion MNIST consist of cloths images, i.e. 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

<h2>Library used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Tensorflow</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
</ul>

 <b>Keras:</b> a high-level API, to build and train models<br/>
 <b>tf.keras</b> is TensorFlow's implementation of the Keras API specification.
 
 <h2>Steps involved:</h2>
 
 1. Importing required libraries.
 2. Loading Fashion MNIST dataset
 3. Verifying the loaded dataset by plotting the first 25 images from training dataset.
 3. Building model and adding layers.
 4. Adding optimizer and loss function.
 5. Training the model.
 6. Evaluating accuracy.
 7. Making predictions.
